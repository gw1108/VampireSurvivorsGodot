#  Every workshop PowerShell script dot-sources this file for its DEFAULTS.
#  Any CLI param still overrides it (e.g. ./start-workshop.ps1 -Iterations 5).
#  See README.md for the full walkthrough.
#
#  The Workshop is the SINGLE-agent counterpart to the fleet (../ralph): one
#  agent at a time, fresh context each pass, draining an operator-curated
#  backlog toward GOAL.md. No worktrees / lanes / refinery / planner.
