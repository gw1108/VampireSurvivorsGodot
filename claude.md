# Claude.md

The role of this file is to describe common mistakes and confusion points that agents might encounter as they work in this project. If you ever encounter something in the project that surprises you, please alert the developer working with you and indicate that this is the case in the AgentMD file to help prevent future agents from having the same issue.

## Operating Principles (Non-Negotiable)

- If something is described or asked for do not ask for confirmation.

## Project Structure

Do NOT scan files in the /thoughts/ folder unless specified.
Do NOT scan files under any folder named ARCHIVE unless specified.

## Workflow Orchestration

### 1. Subagent Strategy (Parallelize Intelligently)
- Use subagents to keep the main context clean and to parallelize:
  - repo exploration, pattern discovery, test failure triage, dependency research, risk review.
- Give each subagent **one focused objective** and a concrete deliverable:
  - "Find where X is implemented and list files + key functions" beats "look around."

### 2. Incremental Delivery (Reduce Risk)
- Prefer **thin vertical slices** over big-bang changes.

### 3. Self-Improvement Loop
- After any user correction or a discovered mistake, add a new entry to `tasks/lessons.md`.
- Keep each entry minimal: a short **category header** (e.g. `### Research scoping`) plus a **one-line prevention rule**. Nothing else.
- The category lets future agents skim and skip entries that look unrelated without reading the body. If a rule needs more context to be actionable, the category itself is too broad.
- Before adding a new entry, check if an existing category already covers it; extend or refine that line instead of duplicating.
